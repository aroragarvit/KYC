       - IMPORTANT: Name variations that appear to be nicknames, informal versions, or different 
         formatting of the same name should NOT be counted as genuine discrepancies
       - IMPORTANT: Address differences that are clearly the same physical location but formatted 
         differently should NOT be treated as discrepancies

       - List all required documents that are missing for complete KYC verification
       - Explain why each missing document is required based on regulatory requirements
